                <h1>Syntactically Awesome Style Sheet</h1>
                <h3>is a preprocessor scripting language that is a superset of CSS.
                    It provides additional features and functionalities that are not
                    available in regular CSS. SCSS syntax is very similar to CSS, 
                    but it allows for the use of variables, nesting, mixins, and other 
                    programming constructs.</h3>

            <p>The term SCSS is an acronym for Sassy Cascading Style Sheets. It is basically 
                a more advanced and evolved variant of the CSS language. Natalie Weizenbaum 
                and Chris Eppstein created it, and Hampton Catlin designed it. It comes with 
                more advanced features- thus often called Sassy CSS. This language is a preprocessor 
                one, and we need to compile or interrupt it into the CSS language. The SCSS language 
                comes with a file extension, namely .scss.</p>
